Hey there, fellow knowledge-seekers! I've recently joined the ranks of the intellectually elite by signing up for the [codwars.com](https://www.codewars.com/)) platform. But alas, despite my undeniably brilliant performance, I was unable to bask in the glory of my high score on the dashboard :). So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create `MeKata` - my very own learning dashboard for every platform am gonna join to learn Problem solving!

Because let's be real, who needs those mediocre dashboards anyway? With `MeKata`, you'll have access to the most cutting-edge, state-of-the-art technology available on the market: a notepad and a pen. But don't let the simplicity fool you - this is where the magic happens. With `MeKata`, you'll be able to track your progress, set goals, and watch in amazement as your brain expands like a balloon on a helium-infused rampage.well when i know how to build something like that :(

So, join me on this epic journey of self-improvement and enlightenment. Who knows, maybe we'll even surpass the knowledge of the ancient Greek philosophers. Or at least get a few extra points on that pesky dashboard. Let's do this!
